# Explanation of the VCard

I wanted to recreate a part of my Curriculum Vitae I made on paper before I started this course.
I already had my style in mind because of that.

The most important features for me were:
- non-scrollable
- border around page
- sticky social media
- full page / half page layout

I managed to make this look nice, but there still some flaws in the code that aren't logical. I'll try to improve this during the next assignments with more skills.
