## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project.

## Timing

I worked on this exercise the 26th and 27th of February 2019. This is during my eductaional training at BeCode to become a web developer.

## What is it?

I wanted to recreate a part of my Curriculum Vitae I made on paper before I started this course.
I already had my style in mind because of that.

The most important features for me were:
- non-scrollable
- border around page
- sticky social media
- full page / half page layout

## Progress

I managed to make this look nice, though there is some code that isn't build up logically. For now, I consider this project as done since it strokes with the project terms. There's always a possibility to make it better anyway. The website is also not responsive for now.
